üìä Balancing ECG Classes using SMOTE in MATLAB
This section of our ECG Arrhythmia Detection project focuses on resolving one of the most critical issues in biomedical datasets‚Äîclass imbalance‚Äîusing a custom SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) implementation.

üîç Why Balance the Data?
The dataset derived from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (via Kaggle) was highly imbalanced:

Class	Original Count
N	884,214
VEB	51,669
SVEB	18,540
Q	7,975
F	1,256

Training a model on this distribution would result in bias toward the majority class ("N"), and poor recall for minority classes like "F", "Q", and "SVEB".

üõ† What SMOTE Did
We implemented a custom SMOTE-based function in MATLAB to:

Downsample the majority class ("N") to 51,669 samples.

Oversample minority classes ("F", "Q", "SVEB") up to 51,669 each.

Ensure all 5 classes (["N", "VEB", "SVEB", "Q", "F"]) have balanced representation.

üíª Code Snippet:
matlab
Copy
Edit
% Load and split dataset
data = T_normalized;
original_features = data{:, 3:end};         
original_labels = string(data{:, 2});       

% Target class balance
target_classes = ["N","VEB","SVEB", "Q", "F"];
target_count = 51669;

% Apply custom SMOTE
[X_full_bal, Y_full_bal] = customSMOTE_to_target_all(original_features, original_labels, target_classes, target_count);
üìä Resulting Distribution
Class	Before SMOTE	After SMOTE
F	1,256	51,669
N	884,214	51,669
Q	7,975	51,669
SVEB	18,540	51,669
VEB	51,669	51,669

üìà Visualization
The script also generates a before/after bar chart of class distribution to visually confirm balance:

matlab
Copy
Edit
subplot(1,2,1)
bar(categorical(unique_labels_before), counts_before)
title('Before Balancing')

subplot(1,2,2)
bar(categorical(unique_labels_after), counts_after)
title('After Balancing (SMOTE + Downsampling)')
‚úÖ Benefits
Eliminated classification bias toward "Normal"

Improved recall and precision for underrepresented classes

Enabled better multi-class performance (as seen in the confusion matrix results
