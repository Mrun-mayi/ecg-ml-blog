# üîÑ Project Update ‚Äì ECG Classification Progress Report

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Research & Methodology

Over the past few weeks, we‚Äôve conducted a deep dive into various machine learning techniques for ECG classification.

The data is from MIT-BIH (Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Beth Israel Hospital)
--The data we used already had features extractured from the raw files in it already. This the kaggle link of the data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sadmansakib7/ecg-arrhythmia-classification-dataset

We processed real ECG datasets below are the files that we used: 

- MIT-BIH Arrhythmia
- INCART 2-lead Arrhythmia
- MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia
- Sudden Cardiac Death Holter


- ‚öôÔ∏è **Data Cleaning** using MATLAB 
We have done Fillmissing in matlab that basically takes the average of the top values to populate the missing values. 

The combined and cleaned data breakdown came to the below: 

+------------+--------+
| Data Type  | Count  |
+------------+--------+
| Normal     | 884214 |
| VEB        | 51669  |
| SVEB       | 18540  |
| Q          | 7975   |
| F          | 1256   |
+------------+--------+

ü´Ä Total data = 963,654
