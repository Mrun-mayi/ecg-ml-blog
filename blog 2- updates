# 🔄 Project Update – ECG Classification Progress Report

## 👨‍🔬 Research & Methodology

Over the past few weeks, we’ve conducted a deep dive into various machine learning techniques for ECG classification.

We explored:

- ✅ **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for high-dimensional data
- 📌 **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** for simplicity
- 🌲 **Random Forests** for ensemble accuracy
- 🧠 **Deep Learning models** like CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM hybrids for spatial and temporal feature learning

## 📈 Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

We processed real ECG datasets such as:

- MIT-BIH Arrhythmia
- INCART 2-lead Arrhythmia

Steps taken:

- ⚙️ **Data Cleaning** using MATLAB (`normalize`, `zscore`, `transform`)
- 🧬 **Feature Extraction**:
  - R-R Intervals
  - QRS Complex Duration
  - P-wave & T-wave Morphology
  - FFT and Wavelet Transforms for frequency features

## 🤖 Model Training & Evaluation

We trained various models using MATLAB tools like:

- `fitctree`, `fitcsvm`, `confusionmat`, `crossval`

Our CNN-LSTM model achieved up to **99.7% accuracy** in detecting ventricular ectopic beats (VEB), showcasing excellent performance for real-time ECG classification.
