# 🔄 Project Update – ECG Classification Progress Report

## 👨‍🔬 Research & Methodology

Over the past few weeks, we’ve conducted a deep dive into various machine learning techniques for ECG classification.

---

We processed real ECG datasets such as:

- MIT-BIH Arrhythmia
- INCART 2-lead Arrhythmia

Steps taken:

- ⚙️ **Data Cleaning** using MATLAB 
We have done Fillmissing in matlab that basically takes the average of the top values to populate the missing values. 
We have drawn various types of graph to explore the data. Graph such as correlation matrix, boxplot, histogram. 




We’re closing in on a practical tool to revolutionize cardiac diagnostics. Stay with us for more breakthroughs!
