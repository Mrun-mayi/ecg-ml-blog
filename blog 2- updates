# 🔄 Project Update – ECG Classification Progress Report

## 👨‍🔬 Research & Methodology

Over the past few weeks, we’ve conducted a deep dive into various machine learning techniques for ECG classification.

---

We processed real ECG datasets such as:

- MIT-BIH Arrhythmia
- INCART 2-lead Arrhythmia

Steps taken:

- ⚙️ **Data Cleaning** using MATLAB 
We have removed all the rows and columns with missing data.
