# 🩺 ECG Signal Classification for Arrhythmia Detection Using Machine Learning in MATLAB

## 👋 Introduction

Hello World!  
We are **Mrunmayi Sanjay Badgujar** and **Venayak Krishi Pillay**, final-year mechanical student at the university of the south pacific working on a critical health-tech project titled **"ECG Signal Classification for Arrhythmia Detection using Machine Learning in MATLAB"** for our MM466 course.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

Cardiac arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that can be dangerous if not detected early. Manual ECG analysis is time-consuming and error-prone. Our solution is to automate the ECG classification process using **machine learning**, which promises better accuracy, speed, and reliability in detecting heart conditions.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

Our approach involves:

- 📥 **Preprocessing** ECG data from the **MIT-BIH** databases
- 🔍 **Feature Extraction** from time and frequency domains
- 🤖 **Training Machine Learning Models** like SVM, k-NN, Random Forest, CNN, and LSTM
- 💻 **Developing a GUI in MATLAB** for real-time ECG signal classification

## 🌍 Impact

This system will assist healthcare professionals by:

- Reducing diagnostic errors  
- Enabling real-time and remote ECG analysis  
- Supporting telemedicine and wearable health applications  

Stay tuned as we transform code into care 💙
