🤖 Model Training and Evaluation – ECG Classification in MATLAB
This part of the project focuses on training and evaluating machine learning models for detecting arrhythmias from ECG data. After preprocessing, balancing the dataset using SMOTE, and partitioning the data into training, validation, and test sets, we trained a wide range of models using MATLAB.

🧠 Models Trained
We trained 12 different classification models using MATLAB’s Classification Learner and custom scripts. These include:

🔷 Traditional ML Models:
Decision Tree

Random Forest

k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naïve Bayes

🔶 Neural Network Variants:
Narrow Neural Network

Medium Neural Network

Wide Neural Network

Bilayered Neural Network

Trilayered Neural Network

🔁 Cross-Validated Models:
K-Fold Tree

K-Fold Naïve Bayes

K-Fold Random Forest

🧪 Evaluation Process
Each model was evaluated using:

X_test – the 15% test set held out after SMOTE

Accuracy Score – calculated as the percentage of correct predictions

Confusion Matrix – visual summary of classification results
